## Four new(er) kinds on the block

* Fossil (2006)
* Plastic (2006)
* Veracity (2011)
* Pijul (2015)

note: 
These four Version Control Systems have been published after the large Distributed Version Control wave in March/April 2005.
I knowingly didn't choose to investigate products that were published *before* Git.
Because let's face it: these products have already been beaten by a newer product - being Git.
So I can't imagine any product older than Git to still beat it in the future.
If that would be true, it should have happened already.
And... it didn't!

## Veracity (2011)

* Distributed version control
* Issue tracking and wiki, also distributed

## But
#### Veracity is not going to be 'the Git killer'

* Development status: web site appears unmaintained; latest release March 25, 2013	
* Hosting platform www.onveracity.com hasn't been online since February 4, 2015

note:
Sorry if this is a bit of an anti-climax.
But in the talk abstract I included Veracity as one of the contenders.
And when I wrote the abstract I never thought about the fact that it could disappear from the Internet altogether.
Because that's literally what happened.
But no worries, I've found a replacement contender!
Which is Plastic.

# Plastic

* Fast branching
* Merge previews
* Both central and distributed
* Comes with **a lot** of GUI stuff

note:
Git has most of these features already.
It just lacks the GUI stuff.

## Focus on artists and designers

* 'Plastic Gluon' is a version control component meant for artists and designers
* Image diffing
* References on their website are exclusively from game studios

note:
In game studios a lot of different expertise is joined in a team.
Programmers, designers, artists. 
And they all need to use the same code repository.
So for them it seems to make sense to add GUI tools to help their source code management.

## But
#### Plastic is not going to be 'the Git killer'

* it's not open-source software
* Git users are not changing their VCS just for some *eye candy*

note:
* **not open-source software**
  * apparently, the story of BitKeeper has not taught the people of Plastic **anything**
* Git users are not changing their VCS just for some *eye candy*
  * most of them are used to using the command-line.
  * those who are not are probably using a web-based product, or SourceTree or GitHub Desktop.
