note:
Speaking of browser market shares, when I was in college I did a talk on 'the browser wars'.
The talk was actually quite similar to the one I'm doing right now.
Because it was also about predictions.
In this college talk I tried to predict what browser we would be using ten years later in time.

Now in the year I did this talk the hurricane Katrina struck the southern coast of the USA.
Also in this year a video sharing website called "YouTube" is founded.
And lastly, in this year cyclist Lance Armstrong won his seventh consecutive Tour de France.
(although he was 'stripped' of his titles, because of drug allegations)
So what do you think the year was?

The year was 2005.

note:
This was actually one of the slides I used.
This was fourteen years ago, and it shows.
It looks RETRO, doesn't it?

I mean, the obnoxious headers and footers.
The background gradient.
The page number at the bottom.
Fantastic stuff.

The slide also shows that the Internet Explorer browser family was VERY dominant in 2005.
Almost 90% of all Internet users used an IE browser.
In this talk I predicted three things, of which two REALLY HAPPENED IN THE END.

## In ten years time...

1. ...Internet Explorer would be surpassed as the top browser family;
2. ...Mozilla Firefox would surpass Internet Explorer;
3. ...Mozilla Firefox would be the top browser.

note:
Just the last prediction didn't happen, the other two did!

note:
I didn't count on Google Chrome - a new browser - to take the top spot.
But see!
Internet Explorer WAS surpassed within ten years time.
And Firefox DID surpass IE for a few months in 2016.
OK, technically that did take 11 years, not 10.

## Key question: was I right? 

note:
So, was I right with the browser prediction?
What *was* the most popular browser in 2015?
TODO: samenvoegen met wat hierboven staat.

note:
Now who in their right mind would dare to claim that Google Chrome will be around forever?
I mean, it will probably be gone in ten years or so...
By then it will have been replaced by a superior product.
These replacements in the browser world have happened at least four times until now.
Mosaic was replaced by Netscape, which was replaced by Internet Explorer.
Which was replaced by Internet Explorer, which was replaced by Mozilla Firefox, which was replaced by Google Chrome.
And I can't think of a reason why it wouldn't happen for a fifth time.

note:
So let's see how these things have happened until now in the version control world!
