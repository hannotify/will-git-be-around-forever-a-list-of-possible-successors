## Three new(er) kids on the block

* Plastic (2006)
* Fossil (2006)
* Pijul (2015)

note: 
These three Version Control Systems have been published after the large Distributed Version Control wave in March/April 2005.
I knowingly didn't choose to investigate products that were published *before* Git.
Because let's face it: these products have already been beaten by a newer product - being Git.
So I can't imagine any product older than Git to still beat it in the future.
If that would be true, it should have happened already.
And... it didn't!

# Plastic

* Fast branching <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
* Merge previews <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
* Both central and distributed <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
* Comes with a lot of GUI stuff <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->

note:
Git has most of these features already.
It just lacks the GUI stuff.

## Focus on artists and designers

* 'Plastic Gluon' is a version control component meant for artists and designers <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
* Image diffing <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
* References on their website are exclusively from game studios <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->

note:
In game studios a lot of different expertise is joined in a team.
Programmers, designers, artists. 
And they all need to use the same code repository.
So for them it seems to make sense to add GUI tools to help their source code management.

## But
#### Plastic is not going to be 'the Git killer'

* it's not open-source software <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
* Git users are not changing their VCS just for some eye candy <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->

note:
* **not open-source software**
  * apparently, the story of BitKeeper has not taught the people of Plastic **anything**
* Git users are not changing their VCS just for some *eye candy*
  * most of them are used to using the command-line.
  * those who are not are probably using a web-based product, or SourceTree or GitHub Desktop.
