Hi, my name is Hanno. 
I work at Info Support as an IT consultant.

Also, I'm from the Netherlands.
Now, everything you've heard about my country is probably true.
I mean:

* Before we go to work in the morning, we put on our wooden clogs.
* Also, we never drive cars to work, no! We ride our bikes.
  * Or if it's winter, we ice-skate.
* On our daily commute we easily pass ten different windmills.
* And when it's lunch time, the office cafeteria serves stroopwafels ONLY.

note:
Who has heard about stroopwafels already?
If you haven't: a stroopwafel is the best cookie in the world.
And of course I brought some with me, because in my country we have plenty of them.
So feel free to grab one after the talk.
Or DURING the talk, if you get bored.
Mind you, I didn't say WHEN you get bored!
I said IF you get bored!
There's a big difference!
Or at least I hope there is.
