# Some surprising facts on Git

---

* "First Linux, now Git"

[https://www.infoworld.com/article/2669670/after-controversy--torvalds-begins-work-on--git-.html](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2669670/after-controversy--torvalds-begins-work-on--git-.html)  <!-- .element: class="attribution" -->

note:
When asked why he called the new software, "git," British slang meaning "a rotten person," he said. "I'm an egotistical bastard, so I name all my projects after myself. First Linux, now git."

* WWCVSND?

[https://twobithistory.org/2018/07/07/cvs.html](https://twobithistory.org/2018/07/07/cvs.html)

note:
When Linus Torvalds was developing Git, one of his guiding principles was WWCVSND, or “What Would CVS Not Do.” Take CVS as an example of what not to do; if in doubt, make the exact opposite decision.

# Why has Git become so popular?

note:
In Stack Overflow’s 2015 developer survey, 69.3% of respondents used Git, almost twice as many as used the second-most-popular version control system, Subversion.1 After 2015, Stack Overflow stopped asking developers about the version control systems they use, perhaps because Git had become so popular that the question was uninteresting.
