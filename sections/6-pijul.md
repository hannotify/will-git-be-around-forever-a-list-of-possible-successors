## Features that Pijul promises

* distributed version control <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
* simple, because of its basis on a sound theory of patches <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
* fast, because it aims to fix the Darcs performance issues <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
* interactive recording <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->

note:
Darcs is a version control system from 2003 that is also patch-based.
However it didn't gain much popularity due to the fact that it was very slow.

## Quick facts

<ul>
    <li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">written in Rust
    <li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">bootstrapped since April 2017
    <li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">free code hosting at 
    <a href="https://nest.pijul.com">https://nest.pijul.com</a> 
</ul>

note:
Rust is one of the faster languages around, because it is a low-level language.
Its performance is comparable to that of C++.

Bootstrapped means that it is used for its own development.

## Patch-oriented design

<ul>
    <li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">A patch is an intuitive atomic unit of work.</li>
    <li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">It focuses on <em>changes</em>, instead of <em>differences between snapshots</em> (i.e. Git commits).</li>
    <li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Applying or unapplying a patch <em>doesn't change</em> its identity.</li>
    <li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">The end result of applying several patches is always the same, regardless of the order in which they were applied.</li>
    <li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Pijul keeps track of 'dependent patches'</li>
    <li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">No merges or rebases; applying a patch is like <code>git cherry-pick</code>.</li>
</ul>

note:
In contrast, Git doesn't store any patches.
It stores snapshots.

## Quick demo

* Up and running
* Recording patches
* Nest demo - <https://nest.pijul.com/pijul_org/pijul>

note:

### Up and running

    pijul init demo
    touch Sample.java
    pijul status
    pijul add Sample.java
    mkdir directory
    pijul add directory
    pijul status
    pijul record

(Here `y` means yes, `n` means no, `k` means undo and remake last decision, `a` means include this and all remaining patches, `d` means include neither this patch nor the remaining patches and `i` means ignore this file locally (i.e. it is added to .pijul/local/ignore).)

### Generating random numbers

**!!! Roll the die on stage !!!**

    public class Sample { 
        public static void main(String... args) {
            System.out.println(random());
        }
        private static int random() {
            // Chosen by fair dice roll; guaranteed to be random.
            return 4;
        }
    }

    pijul add Sample.java
    pijul record
    private static int random() {
        return (int)(Math.random() * 6);
    }
    pijul add Sample.java
    pijul record
    private static int random() {
        return new java.util.Random().nextInt(7);
    }
    pijul add Sample.java
    pijul record

    pijul unrecord // unrecord all patches and squash them into one
    pijul add .
    pijul record

Zie `misc/MyRandom.java` voor als je de details vergeet.
