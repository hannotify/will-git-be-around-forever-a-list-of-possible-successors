**Time Elapsed:** 3 min.

Now, any time if I hear somebody say that [insert-product-name-here] "will probably be around forever", it immediately reminds me of...

...this. 

If working in software development for over 11 years has taught me anything, it's that...

note:
...change is the only constant. 
This idea has been valid in our industry for as long as I remember.
If you think about it for just a second, you can come up with lots of examples.

* Requirements change.
* Priorities change. 
* Dependencies change.
* Browser behaviours change.

Agile was invented for a reason! To be able to cope with CHANGE.
Because change is the only constant.

note:
And although Newton (*point*) probably talked about an apple here, his quote can be applied to a lot of things, including:

* airplanes;
* Bitcoin price;
* browser market shares;
* version control system market shares.

---

note:
Speaking of browser market shares, when I was in college I did a talk on 'the browser wars'.
The talk was actually quite similar to the one I'm doing right now.
In this college talk I tried to predict what browser we would be using ten years later in time.
The year was 2005.

TODO: random feitje uit 2005, om het jaartal wat 'dramatischer' te kunnen onthullen.

note:
This was actually one of the slides I used.
This was fourteen years ago!

TODO: add retro slide.

---

note:
Now 'the browser wars' are a VERY good example of Newton's statement.
Because in the beginning, there was the Mosaic text-based browser.
Until it came down and the top browser became Netscape Navigator.
Until it came down and the top browser became Microsoft Internet Explorer.
Until it came down and the top browser became Mozilla Firefox.
Until it came down and the top browser became Google Chrome.

## Key question: was I right? 

note:
So, was I right with the browser prediction?
What *was* the most popular browser in 2015?
TODO: afmaken.

---

note:
Now who in their right mind would dare to claim that Google Chrome will be around forever?
I mean, it will probably be gone in ten years or so...
By then it will have been replaced by a superior product.
These replacements in the browser world have happened at least four times until now.
And I can't think of a reason why it wouldn't happen for a fifth time.

---

note:
So let's see how these things have happened in the version control world!
