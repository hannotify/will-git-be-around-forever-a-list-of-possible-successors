* Fossil (2006)
* Plastic (2006)
* Veracity (2011)
* Pijul (2015)

note: 
These four Version Control Systems have been published after the large Distributed Version Control wave in March/April 2005. 

FIXME: why did I choose to consider these four and not a few older ones?

---

# Veracity

* Distributed version control
* Issue tracking and wiki, also distributed

<!-- FINAL: add Veracity logo -->

## But
#### Veracity is not going to be 'the Git killer'

* Development status: web site appears unmaintained; latest release March 25, 2013	
* Hosting platform onveracity.com hasn't been online since February 4, 2015

note:
FIXME - why was this one even in the abstract and why that's the only reason I have included it.

# Plastic

* Fast branching
* Merge previews
* Both central and distributed
* Comes with **a lot** of GUI stuff

<!-- FINAL: add Plastic logo -->

note:
Git has most of these features already.
It just lacks the GUI stuff.

## Focus on artists and designers

* 'Plastic Gluon' is a version control component meant for artists and designers
* Image diffing
* Their references are almost exclusively game studios

note:
In game studios a lot of different expertise is joined in a team.
Programmers, designers, artists. 
And they all need to use the same code repository.
So for them it seems to make sense to add GUI tools to help their source code management.

## But
#### Plastic is not going to be 'the Git killer'

* it's not open-source software
* Git users are not switching SCM's just for some *eye candy*

note:
* **not open-source software**
  * apparently, the story of BitKeeper has not taught the people of Plastic **anything**
* Git users are not switching SCM's just for some *eye candy*
  * most of them are used to using the command-line.
  * those who are not are probably using a web-based product, or SourceTree or GitHub Desktop.
