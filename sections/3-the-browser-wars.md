# The Browser Wars

<https://pxhere.com/en/photo/652221> <!-- .element: class="attribution" -->

note:
**Time Elapsed:** 16 min.

This is exactly what happened during 'The Browser Wars'.
Multiple times, actually.
When I was in college I did a talk on 'the browser wars'.
In this college talk I tried to predict what browser we would be using ten years later in time.
So the talk was actually quite similar to this one.
Apart from the fact that my slides back then looked **very** different.

note:
This was actually one of the slides I used.
Now notice the date, in the bottom left corner.
This slide deck was created fourteen years ago, and it shows.
It's a RETRO slide deck.

I mean, the obnoxious headers and footers.
Which were present on **every** slide.
They were obviously a major waste of space.
Also: the background gradient.
The page number at the bottom.
Horrifying stuff!
I think slide deck designs are a lot like fashion.
If you just wait for fifteen years, they will be popular again.
Don't you think so?

Anyway, apart from the fact that this slide causes your eyes to sting, it also shows that the Internet Explorer browser family was VERY dominant in 2005.
Almost 90% of all Internet users used an IE browser.
Now in this college talk I predicted three things, of which two **actually really happened**.
These were my predictions:

---

## In ten years time...

1. ...Internet Explorer would be surpassed as the top browser family;
2. ...Mozilla Firefox would surpass Internet Explorer;
3. ...Mozilla Firefox would be the top browser.

note:

## In ten years time...

1. ...Internet Explorer would be surpassed as the top browser family;
2. ...Mozilla Firefox would surpass Internet Explorer;
3. ...Mozilla Firefox would be the top browser.

## In ten years time...

1. ...Internet Explorer would be surpassed as the top browser family;
2. ...Mozilla Firefox would surpass Internet Explorer;
3. ~...Mozilla Firefox would be the top browser.~

note:
Just the last prediction didn't happen, the other two did!

note:
I didn't count on Google Chrome - a new browser - to take the top spot.
But see!
Internet Explorer WAS surpassed within ten years time.
And Firefox DID surpass IE for a few months in 2016.
OK, technically that did take 11 years, not 10.

note:
Still, I was right! 
Sort of.
I correctly predicted that Internet Explorer would be surpassed by a new browser.

## The disadvantage of the dominant product

    You will get a lot of attention.

note:
Now I was quite confident this would happen, because of a mechanism I like to call:
"The disadvantage of the dominant product"

The dominant product will get a lot of attention. 
Both positive *and* negative.
Your product - or the users of your product - could be popular victims of malicious software
(This is the reason why there are so many viruses on Windows, compared to Linux for example)
Also, if more people know your product, then in theory they can come up with fresh new ideas that your product doesn't have.
Just like in sports, it is a lot harder to stay on top, than it is to get there.

## The disadvantage of the dominant product

note:
So here's our final prediction variable.
It is hard to stay on top, hence "the disadvantage of the dominant product".
Eventually the dominant product will be replaced by a new one, like the browser world.
Netscape was replaced by Internet Explorer.
Internet Explorer was replaced by Mozilla Firefox
Mozilla Firefox was replaced by Google Chrome.
And I can't think of a reason why it wouldn't happen again.

So let's return to the version control world antd see which products we need to investigate as aspiring successors of Git!
