# Teaching a course on Git

note:
**Time Elapsed:** 1 min.

Besides doing consultancy work, I also teach a few courses.
Now at Info Support we offer a wide range of courses, which exist mainly to get our junior colleagues up to speed with important concepts or products they'll need for their daily work.

One of the courses I teach is called 'Git for Developers'.
It's a one-day course where I teach the students how to use Git as a developer (none of that GUI stuff of course; command-line For The Win!).
Besides doing the practical stuff we also discuss the pros and cons of distributed version control systems and how they compare to the earlier VCS's, like CVS and Subversion.

note:
This is actually one of the course slides.
And it shows which version control systems have emerged in the past and when they became available.
It tries to put the publication date of each version control system in perspective by comparing them to the most modern phone known at that time.

So, Subversion relates to the Nokia 3210, for example. (*point*)
And CVS relates to the thing with the power plug.

Now, when I talk about this slide during the Git course, I tend to focus on the events of the year 2005.
Because to me, 2005 REALLY stands out in version control history.
I mean, FIVE new version control systems were published in that year. 
In a single year.

To put this number in context, before 2005, it had taken NINE years for five version control systems to emerge.
Starting with VSS in 1994, and ending with BitKeeper in 2003.
And in 2005, it all happened within a few months.

So, who knows why it happened like this?

note:
The answer is BitKeeper!

note:
Now just because I thought the year 2005 really stood out in this graphic, doesn't necessarily mean it was like that for everyone.
In fact, at the end of the course day a student came to me with a question.
And his question proved that he had noticed an entirely different thing than I had noticed.
Moreover, his 'discovery' - if you will - proved to be a LOT more interesting than mine.

He came over to me and said: "Git is great and all that, but what is gonna be the next big thing?"
So I told him I was quite sure distributed version control systems like Git and Mercurial would be around for a while longer.
But to be honest, I didn't really know the answer.
So it was a great question, actually.

And he was right in asking this question, of course.
Because if you look at the chart and you look beyond what you've already seen (the year 2005), then it becomes painfully obvious
In version control land, nothing seems to have happened after 2006.
This is one of those things that, once you see it, you can't UNSEE it.

---

note:
Now I really hated the fact that I couldn't tell him more on the subject, so I decided to research the matter a bit further.
And what started out as finding the answer to a simple question turned into giving a conference talk.
Which is the one you're attending right now!

So, welcome to you all.
I'm going to assume that you are all more or less like the student I told you about.
He just couldn't believe that everything in version control land would stay the same for a long period of time.
And I hope you're also a little bit like me, because you probably also can't stand not being able to know the answer to a question.
So, let's see if we can find the answer together, shall we?

Now, whenever I hear somebody say that [insert-product-name-here] "will probably be around forever", it immediately reminds me of...

...this quote. 

If working in software development for almost 12 years has taught me anything, it's that...

note:
...change is the only constant. 
This idea has been valid in our industry for as long as I remember.
If you think about it for just a second, you can come up with lots of examples.

* Requirements change.
* Priorities change. 
* Dependencies change.
* Browser behaviours change.

Agile was invented for a reason! To be able to cope with CHANGE.
Because change is the only constant, and has been for a long time.

note:
Now if the idea of "Change is the only constant" is valid in our industry, then so is the idea of "What goes up, must come down".
And although Newton (*point*) probably talked about an apple here, his quote can be applied to a lot of things, including:

* airplanes;
* Bitcoin prices;
* browser market shares;
* and maybe even version control system market shares.

TODO: overweeg om hier extra plaatjes te gebruiken.

Throughout this talk, we'll discover several ideas that I will use as input variables for the prediction at the end of the talk. The idea of "What's goes up..." is actually the first variable that we'll use.

TODO: maak een plaatje voor 'Prediction variable', dat bij elk nieuw ge√Øntroduceerd idee als een fragment op de slide gegooid wordt.
