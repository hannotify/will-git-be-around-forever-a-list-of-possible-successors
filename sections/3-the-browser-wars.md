# The Browser Wars

note:
**Time Elapsed:** 25 min.

This is not the first time I'm speaking on popularity of a software product.
When I was in college I did a talk on 'the browser wars'.
In this college talk I tried to predict what browser we would be using ten years later in time.

note:
This was actually one of the slides I used.
Now notice the date, in the bottom left corner.
This slide deck was created fourteen years ago, and it shows.
It's a RETRO slide deck.

I mean, the obnoxious headers and footers.
The background gradient.
The page number at the bottom.
Fantastic stuff.
If you would just wait for fifteen years, it would be fashionable again.

The slide also shows that the Internet Explorer browser family was VERY dominant in 2005.
Almost 90% of all Internet users used an IE browser.
Now in this talk I predicted three things, of which two **actually really happened**.
These were my predictions:

---

## In ten years time...

1. ...Internet Explorer would be surpassed as the top browser family;
2. ...Mozilla Firefox would surpass Internet Explorer;
3. ...Mozilla Firefox would be the top browser.

note:
Just the last prediction didn't happen, the other two did!

note:
I didn't count on Google Chrome - a new browser - to take the top spot.
But see!
Internet Explorer WAS surpassed within ten years time.
And Firefox DID surpass IE for a few months in 2016.
OK, technically that did take 11 years, not 10.

note:
Still, I was right! 
Sort of.
I correctly predicted that Internet Explorer would be surpassed by a new browser.

## The disadvantage of the dominant product

note:
Now I was quite confident this would happen, because of a mechanism I like to call:
"The disadvantage of the dominant product"

FIXME: leg dit mechanisme beter uit. Wat er zeker in moet voorkomen:
* een dominant product trekt meer aandacht, zowel positief als negatief:
  * vatbaarder voor maliciousness - zie virussen op Windows vs. Linux
  * meer mensen kennen je product en kunnen in theorie iets nieuws verzinnen dat je product nog niet heeft.

FIXME: Introduceer deze variable. Voeg waar mogelijk samen met het verhaal hieronder.

Because who in their right mind would dare to claim that Google Chrome will be around forever?
I mean, it will probably be gone in ten years or so...
By then it will have been replaced by a superior product.
These replacements in the browser world have happened at least four times until now.
Mosaic was replaced by Netscape, which was replaced by Internet Explorer.
Which was replaced by Internet Explorer, which was replaced by Mozilla Firefox, which was replaced by Google Chrome.
And I can't think of a reason why it wouldn't happen for a fifth time.

FIXME: bedenk een verbindende zin naar het volgende onderwerp. 
En hopelijk iets beters dan wat er nu staat.

So let's see how these things have happened until now in the version control world!
