## Two new(er) kids on the block

* Fossil (2006)
* Pijul (2015)

note: 
These two Version Control Systems have been published after the large Distributed Version Control wave in March/April 2005.
I knowingly didn't choose to investigate products that were published *before* Git.
Because let's face it: these products have already been beaten by a newer product - being Git.
So I can't imagine any product older than Git to still beat it in the future.

I used to have a VCS called 'Plastic' on this list.
But that one focuses primarily on game studios, where contributors work with graphics and other binary files.
Also, it's proprietary software. Apparently they haven't heard the BitKeeper story yet.
So it's a nice addition to the market as it fills a niche, but because of that and the closed-source license I highly doubt it will replace Git in the end.
